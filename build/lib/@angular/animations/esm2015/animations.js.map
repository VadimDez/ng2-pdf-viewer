If this information is new, please navigate to the\n * {\\@link Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better\n * understanding of how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `trigger` Creates an animation trigger which will a list of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} entries that will be evaluated when the expression\n * bound to the trigger changes.\n *\n * Triggers are registered within the component annotation data under the\n * {\\@link Component#animations animations section}. An animation trigger can be placed on an element\n * within a template by referencing the name of the trigger followed by the expression value that\n * the\n * trigger is bound to (in the form of `[\\@triggerName]=\"expression\"`.\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings strigify values and then match the previous and current values against\n * any linked transitions. If a boolean value is provided into the trigger binding then it will both\n * be represented as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false` for a true and false boolean values\n * respectively.\n *\n * ### Usage\n *\n * `trigger` will create an animation trigger reference based on the provided `name` value. The\n * provided `animation` value is expected to be an array consisting of {\\@link state state} and\n * {\\@link transition transition} declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ## Disable Animations\n * A special animation control binding called `\\@.disabled` can be placed on an element which will\n * then disable animations for any inner animation triggers situated within the element as well as\n * any animations on the element itself.\n *\n * When true, the `\\@.disabled` binding will prevent all animations from rendering. The example\n * below shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```ts\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [\\@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The `\\@childAnimation` trigger will not animate because `\\@.disabled` prevents it from happening\n * (when true).\n *\n * Note that `\\@.disbled` will only disable all animations (this means any animations running on\n * the same element will also be disabled).\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations Application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled, **all** inner components will\n * also have their animations disabled as well. This means that all animations for an angular\n * application can be disabled by placing a host binding set on `\\@.disabled` on the topmost Angular\n * component.\n *\n * ```ts\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   \\@HostBinding('\\@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### What about animations that us `query()` and `animateChild()`?\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can {\\@link query query} for inner\n * elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate them as it sees fit. This is\n * also the case for when a sub animation is queried by a parent and then later animated using {\\@link\n * animateChild animateChild}.\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} name\n * @param {?} definitions\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function trigger(name, definitions) {\n    return { type: 7 /* Trigger */, name, definitions, options: {} };\n}\n/**\n * `animate` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language. If this information is new, please navigate to the {\\@link\n * Component#animations component animations metadata page} to gain a better understanding of\n * how animations in Angular are used.\n *\n * `animate` specifies an animation step that will apply the provided `styles` data for a given\n * amount of time based on the provided `timing` expression value.

If left empty then the styles from the destination state will be collected\n * and used (this is useful when describing an animation step that will complete an animation by\n * {\\@link transition#the-final-animate-call animating to the final state}).\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // various functions for specifying timing data\n * animate(500, style(...))\n * animate(\"1s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"100ms 0.5s\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s ease\", style(...))\n * animate(\"5s 10ms cubic-bezier(.17,.67,.88,.1)\", style(...))\n *\n * // either style() of keyframes() can be used\n * animate(500, style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * animate(500, keyframes([\n *   style({ background: \"blue\" })),\n *   style({ background: \"red\" }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} timings\n * @param {?=} styles\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animate(timings, styles = null) {\n    return { type: 4 /* Animate */, styles, timings };\n}\n/**\n * `group` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.

In other words, if a transition\n * is defined that matches the old/current state criteria then the associated animation will be\n * triggered.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // all transition/state changes are defined within an animation trigger\n * trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *   // if a state is defined then its styles will be persisted when the\n *   // animation has fully completed itself\n *   state(\"on\", style({ background: \"green\" })),\n *   state(\"off\", style({ background: \"grey\" })),\n *\n *   // a transition animation that will be kicked off when the state value\n *   // bound to \"myAnimationTrigger\" changes from \"on\" to \"off\"\n *   transition(\"on => off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // it is also possible to do run the same animation for both directions\n *   transition(\"on <=> off\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // or to define multiple states pairs separated by commas\n *   transition(\"on => off, off => void\", animate(500)),\n *\n *   // this is a catch-all state change for when an element is inserted into\n *   // the page and the destination state is unknown\n *   transition(\"void => *\", [\n *     style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *     animate(500)\n *   ]),\n *\n *   // this will capture a state change between any states\n *   transition(\"* => *\", animate(\"1s 0s\")),\n *\n *   // you can also go full out and include a function\n *   transition((fromState, toState) => {\n *     // when `true` then it will allow the animation below to be invoked\n *     return fromState == \"off\" && toState == \"on\";\n *   }, animate(\"1s 0s\"))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component will make use of the `myAnimationTrigger` animation\n * trigger by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [\\@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * #### The final `animate` call\n *\n * If the final step within the transition steps is a call to `animate()` that **only** uses a\n * timing value with **no style data** then it will be automatically used as the final animation arc\n * for the element to animate itself to the final state. This involves an automatic mix of\n * adding/removing CSS styles so that the element will be in the exact state it should be for the\n * applied state to be presented correctly.\n *\n * ```\n * // start off by hiding the element, but make sure that it animates properly to whatever state\n * // is currently active for \"myAnimationTrigger\"\n * transition(\"void => *\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500)\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :enter and :leave\n *\n * Given that enter (insertion) and leave (removal) animations are so common, the `transition`\n * function accepts both `:enter` and `:leave` values which are aliases for the `void => *` and `*\n * => void` state changes.\n *\n * ```\n * transition(\":enter\", [\n *   style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n * ]),\n * transition(\":leave\", [\n *   animate(500, style({ opacity: 0 }))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Boolean values\n * if a trigger binding value is a boolean value then it can be matched using a transition\n * expression that compares `true` and `false` or `1` and `0`.\n *\n * ```\n * // in the template\n * <div [\\@openClose]=\"open ? true : false\">...</div>\n *\n * // in the component metadata\n * trigger('openClose', [\n *   state('true', style({ height: '*' })),\n *   state('false', style({ height: '0px' })),\n *   transition('false <=> true', animate(500))\n * ])\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using :increment and :decrement\n * In addition to the :enter and :leave transition aliases, the :increment and :decrement aliases\n * can be used to kick off a transition when a numeric value has increased or decreased in value.\n *\n * ```\n * import {group, animate, query, transition, style, trigger} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * import {Component} from '\\@angular/core';\n *\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'banner-carousel-component',\n *   styles: [`\n *     .banner-container {\n *        position:relative;\n *        height:500px;\n *        overflow:hidden;\n *      }\n *     .banner-container > .banner {\n *        position:absolute;\n *        left:0;\n *        top:0;\n *        font-size:200px;\n *        line-height:500px;\n *        font-weight:bold;\n *        text-align:center;\n *        width:100%;\n *      }\n *   `],\n *   template: `\n *     <button (click)=\"previous()\">Previous</button>\n *     <button (click)=\"next()\">Next</button>\n *     <hr>\n *     <div [\\@bannerAnimation]=\"selectedIndex\" class=\"banner-container\">\n *       <div class=\"banner\"> {{ banner }} </div>\n *     </div>\n *   `\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('bannerAnimation', [\n *       transition(\":increment\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '-100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *       transition(\":decrement\", group([\n *         query(':enter', [\n *           style({ left: '-100%' }),\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style('*'))\n *         ]),\n *         query(':leave', [\n *           animate('0.5s ease-out', style({ left: '100%' }))\n *         ])\n *       ])),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class BannerCarouselComponent {\n *   allBanners: string[] = ['1', '2', '3', '4'];\n *   selectedIndex: number = 0;\n *\n *   get banners() {\n *      return [this.allBanners[this.selectedIndex]];\n *   }\n *\n *   previous() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.max(this.selectedIndex - 1, 0);\n *   }\n *\n *   next() {\n *     this.selectedIndex = Math.min(this.selectedIndex + 1, this.allBanners.length - 1);\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * {\\@example core/animation/ts/dsl/animation_example.ts region='Component'}\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?} stateChangeExpr\n * @param {?} steps\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function transition(stateChangeExpr, steps, options = null) {\n    return { type: 1 /* Transition */, expr: stateChangeExpr, animation: steps, options };\n}\n/**\n * `animation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.\n *\n * `var myAnimation = animation(...)` is designed to produce a reusable animation that can be later\n * invoked in another animation or sequence.

It works by allowing a queried element to execute its own\n * animation within the animation sequence.\n *\n * Each time an animation is triggered in angular, the parent animation\n * will always get priority and any child animations will be blocked. In order\n * for a child animation to run, the parent animation must query each of the elements\n * containing child animations and then allow the animations to run using `animateChild`.\n *\n * The example HTML code below shows both parent and child elements that have animation\n * triggers that will execute at the same time.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- parent-child.component.html -->\n * <button (click)=\"exp =! exp\">Toggle</button>\n * <hr>\n *\n * <div [\\@parentAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *   <header>Hello</header>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       one\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       two\n *   </div>\n *   <div [\\@childAnimation]=\"exp\">\n *       three\n *   </div>\n * </div>\n * ```\n *\n * Now when the `exp` value changes to true, only the `parentAnimation` animation will animate\n * because it has priority. However, using `query` and `animateChild` each of the inner animations\n * can also fire:\n *\n * ```ts\n * // parent-child.component.ts\n * import {trigger, transition, animate, style, query, animateChild} from '\\@angular/animations';\n * \\@Component({\n *   selector: 'parent-child-component',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('parentAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         query('header', [\n *           style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *           animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *         ]),\n *         query('\\@childAnimation', [\n *           animateChild()\n *         ])\n *       ])\n *     ]),\n *     trigger('childAnimation', [\n *       transition('false => true', [\n *         style({ opacity: 0 }),\n *         animate(500, style({ opacity: 1 }))\n *       ])\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class ParentChildCmp {\n *   exp: boolean = false;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * In the animation code above, when the `parentAnimation` transition kicks off it first queries to\n * find the header element and fades it in. It then finds each of the sub elements that contain the\n * `\\@childAnimation` trigger and then allows for their animations to fire.\n *\n * This example can be further extended by using stagger:\n *\n * ```ts\n * query('\\@childAnimation', stagger(100, [\n *   animateChild()\n * ]))\n * ```\n *\n * Now each of the sub animations start off with respect to the `100ms` staggering step.\n *\n * ## The first frame of child animations\n * When sub animations are executed using `animateChild` the animation engine will always apply the\n * first frame of every sub animation immediately at the start of the animation sequence. This way\n * the parent animation does not need to set any initial styling data on the sub elements before the\n * sub animations kick off.\n *\n * In the example above the first frame of the `childAnimation`'s `false => true` transition\n * consists of a style of `opacity: 0`. This is applied immediately when the `parentAnimation`\n * animation transition sequence starts. Only then when the `\\@childAnimation` is queried and called\n * with `animateChild` will it then animate to its destination of `opacity: 1`.\n *\n * Note that this feature designed to be used alongside {\\@link query query()} and it will only work\n * with animations that are assigned using the Angular animation DSL (this means that CSS keyframes\n * and transitions are not handled by this API).\n *\n * \\@experimental Animation support is experimental.\n * @param {?=} options\n * @return {?}\n */\nexport function animateChild(options = null) {\n    return { type: 9 /* AnimateChild */, options };\n}\n/**\n * `useAnimation` is an animation-specific function that is designed to be used inside of Angular's\n * animation DSL language.
